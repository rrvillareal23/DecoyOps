# DecoyOps

DecoyOps is a Python script designed to create a decoy directory structure and simulate live activity within it. This script can be useful for testing and monitoring purposes, especially in cybersecurity contexts where decoy systems are used to detect and trap unauthorized access or modification attempts.

## Overview

The script generates a directory structure consisting of dummy departmental folders, each containing dummy files. It then simulates various activities within this structure, such as file modification, addition, and deletion. Additionally, trap mechanisms are implemented to monitor these actions and provide alerts when detected.

## Features

- **Decoy Directory Structure**: Creates a realistic directory structure with dummy departmental folders and files.
- **Activity Simulation**: Simulates random file modifications, additions, and deletions within the directory structure.
- **Trap Mechanisms**: Implements trap mechanisms to monitor and log file access, modification, addition, and deletion.
- **Logging**: Logs all alterations and trap detections in the `alterations.log` file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DecoyOps.git

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
  cd DecoyOps

3. Run the script:
  python decoy_ops.py


4. **Monitor the output and `alterations.log` for simulated activity and trap detections.**

## Customization

- Adjust the parameters in the script to modify the behavior of the simulation.
- Customize the directory structure and file contents as needed for your testing environment.
